# Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes retail business data to evaluate performance, profitability, and customer trends.
The goal was to identify high-performing products, regional sales trends, inventory gaps, and profitability drivers.

By combining SQL, Python, and Tableau, I designed a complete end-to-end data analysis pipeline to support data-driven decision making.

# 🛠 Tools & Technologies

SQL – Data cleaning, transformation, and business queries

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn) – Data preprocessing, KPI analysis, and predictive modeling

Tableau – Interactive dashboards for performance tracking and insights

# 📂 Project Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removed duplicates, missing values, and standardized formats using SQL & Python

Ensured 95%+ data reliability for accurate insights

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# sales trends, profit margins, and inventory patterns

Segmented customers/products based on sales contribution

Business Insights

Found 30% overstocked products and 20% low-profit items impacting business revenue

Highlighted top-selling categories & high-performing regions

Predicted sales trends using regression modeling

Dashboard & Reporting

Built Tableau dashboards to visualize KPIs (Sales, Profit, Quantity, Category & Region-wise trends)

Automated reporting pipeline → reduced manual effort by 80%

# 📊 Key Insights

✔️ 30% products were overstocked leading to higher holding costs
✔️ 20% products generated negative profit margins → required immediate action
✔️ Top 3 categories contributed 65% of total sales
✔️ Decision-making time reduced by 70% with automated dashboards
